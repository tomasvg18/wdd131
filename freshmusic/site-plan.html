			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Welcome to Fresh Music, here you can discover clean, chill, copyright-free music to help you study, relax, or vibe.  
Pick a genre and start listeningâ€”it's that easy.
<br>-drop down menu for genre select
<br>-play box with functional buttons
<br>-description of song currently playing
<br>-download link for song?
<br>-random song button

</p>
			<h3>Song of the day</h3>
			<p>Automaticaly picks one song from the library to be song of the day, has a play box like the home page but no next/back button 
				as it only plays the song of they day, needs to randomly choose a song from the library every day to feature and not repeat the same song 
				until a week has passed.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I am going to center the text on the footer like in the wireframe for the song of the day
			</p>
			<img src="images/fmhomewf.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Song of the Day</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
